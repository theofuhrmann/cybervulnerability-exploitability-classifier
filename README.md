# Cybervulnerability Exploitability Classifier
*Final thesis*

**Abstract:**

Prioritising the treatment of cybervulnerabilities prone to exploits is essential for software companies. Due to increased frequency and limited resources, the ranking of cybervulnerabilites has become progressively difficult. Current methodologies of detecting cybervulnerability exploits rely heavily on human calculation, which takes time and is prone to error. Using the data from a publicly available cybervulnerability database, this project explains how to train and analyse various Machine Learning classifiers that can predict whether or not a cybervulnerability will be exploited. As opposed to current popular heuristics, the models were able to consider a wider range of information during the predictions through feature extraction. The automated alternative outperformed the current ranking systems while reducing the computational time for the predictions.
